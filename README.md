# Creda Pay

## Open Trust Layer for Digital Payments

Creda Pay is an open protocol that introduces identity, credibility, and trust into digital payments.

Today, digital transactions are fast and borderless — but fundamentally blind.

Participants interact through anonymous wallet addresses with no native way to understand:

- Who they are paying  
- Whether the counterparty is reliable  
- Whether agreements have been honored  
- Whether an organization is legitimate  

Creda Pay transforms payment identities into trust-bearing financial profiles.

It enables individuals, businesses, and communities to build portable financial reputation based on real activity rather than institutional permission.

# Why Creda Pay Exists

Digital finance solved value transfer.

It did not solve trust.

In traditional finance, trust is built through:

- Transaction history  
- Institutional verification  
- Long-term relationships  

In digital systems, this layer is missing.

Payments today are identity-agnostic and reputationless.

Creda Pay introduces a programmable trust layer that allows financial credibility to emerge from participation.

# What Creda Pay Does

Creda Pay converts a wallet into a financial identity.

Instead of interacting with anonymous addresses:

Participants interact with identity-backed payment profiles.

Each identity can include:

- Human-readable name  
- Trust score  
- Verification status  
- Financial relationships  
- Endorsements  

Over time, identity becomes credibility.

# Core Principles

Creda Pay is built on four guiding principles:

### Open Participation
No permission required to create an identity.

### Activity-Based Reputation
Trust emerges from behavior, not status.

### User Ownership
Identity is controlled by the wallet owner.

### Privacy Respect
Verification is optional and opt-in.

---

# System Overview

Creda Pay is composed of four major layers:

## Identity Layer
Maps human-readable names to wallet ownership.

## Activity Layer
Indexes transaction behavior and financial relationships.

## Trust Layer
Computes credibility based on participation patterns.

## Verification Layer
Supports optional identity validation and organizational legitimacy.

---

# Core Components

## Identity Registry

Enables:

username → wallet

Users can:

- Register identity
- Transfer ownership
- Update linked wallet

---

## Public Profile

Each identity can evolve into a financial profile containing:

- Trust signals  
- Activity history  
- Endorsements  
- Verification badges  

---

## Trust Engine

Creda Pay computes reputation using:

- Payment consistency  
- Relationship longevity  
- Participation reliability  
- Peer endorsements  

Trust is derived — not assigned.

---

## Verification System

Optional mechanisms may include:

- Email linkage  
- Organizational validation  
- Community attestations  

Verification enhances trust but is not mandatory.

---

## Financial Graph

Creda Pay builds a relationship network across identities.

This enables:

- Reputation discovery  
- Credibility signals  
- Risk awareness  

---

# Architecture

Creda Pay consists of three primary operational layers:

## On-Chain Layer
Handles:

- Identity ownership  
- Username mapping  
- Attestation anchors  

## Indexing Layer
Tracks:

- Payment behavior  
- Interaction patterns  
- Network signals  

## Trust Computation Layer
Processes:

- Activity metrics  
- Relationship data  
- Endorsements

# High-Level Flow

1. User registers identity  
2. Identity links to wallet  
3. Activity is indexed  
4. Trust score evolves over time  
5. Profile becomes credible
